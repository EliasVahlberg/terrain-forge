# Terrain Forge

A comprehensive procedural generation engine for creating diverse terrain and dungeon layouts.

## Features

- **10+ Generation Algorithms**: BSP, Cellular Automata, DLA, Drunkard Walk, Fractal, Maze, Percolation, Simple Rooms, Voronoi, Wave Function Collapse
- **Constraint Validation System**: Ensures generated maps meet gameplay requirements (tactical positioning, safe zones, escape routes, objective accessibility)
- **Layered Generation**: Multi-pass algorithm composition for complex terrain
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 30+ test configurations with visual output and quality metrics
- **Plugin Architecture**: Runtime algorithm discovery and configuration

## Project Status

This engine is extracted from the Saltglass Steppe project and represents a standalone procedural generation system.

## Documentation

See [PROCEDURAL_GENERATION_ENGINE_SPEC.md](PROCEDURAL_GENERATION_ENGINE_SPEC.md) for detailed architecture and implementation details.
